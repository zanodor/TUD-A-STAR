# Volt

Többféleképpen értelmezhető volt szavunk. Egyrészt M>V váltással kijön [[M/Múlt\|múlt]] szavunkból, másrészt megfelel a forgásra utaló [[V/Vált\|vált]] szavunknak is, ahogy [ezen](https://qr.ae/pKIRyJ) Quora válaszban[^1] is szerepelt.  
[[B/Bolt\|Bolt]] pedig az égbolt, ami (illetve rajta a csillagok) szintén forog(nak).  

Ugyanakkor a [[T/T\|T]] a múlt idő jele is. Ezek szerint vol- kereshető lenne jelen idős jelentéssel? [[B/Bál\|Bál]] és [[B/BUL\|bul]] nevek vannak a hasonlóak közül.  
Ugyebár az idő folyása ([[F/Folyó\|foly-]] szintén ilyen alakú szó!) vagy sziderikusan vagy tropikusan (szolárisan) követhető. Az pedig alapvető a magyar nyelv szavai logikáját tekintve, hogy a Nap-Föld relációra épít.

[^1]: Lábjegyzet:  
*Are there any complex structures similar to the English “have be going to” or “will have been gone” in Finnish, Estonian, Hungarian, and Turkish? Why and why not? How is it expressed?*  
“Have be going to” is incorrect English.  
“Will have been gone” is hardly used in English, either. These are pretty niche cases.  
As for Hungarian, the language had many more cases, including a future tense (`jövend` = will come; compare `jövendő` = future (poetic, formal); `jövő` = future (normal usage)), but the anti-Hungarian forces (Vatican/Catholicism, chief among them the Jesuits, then Habsburg rule) did much damage to the language.  
If one looks closely at the old forms in Hungarian (`volt,` `vala` to construct simple past and/or past perfect tenses) and how Latin and Germanic (based on Latin) are gramatically syntaxed, one can say they could have been formed on a language that could easily have been Hungarian itself.  
Are the Latin and Germanic words expressing volition and future tenses connected to our words `volt` and `vala`, based on the fact that in the circle of time past becomes future (what comes around goes around)?  
(`Volt`, by the way equals `múlt` = past, in case any Hungarians were ever wondering. In fact, these words are related to `vált` = change; turn.)  
See also, for example, `habere`, `haben` are used for possession and present/past perfect. But in order to be in a state of possession or have done something, you must have come into the possession or state of having done something. Hungarian `kap` = come in possession of, receive. Is it a coincidence? Although I am sure we never used a variation of `kap` for any of these tenses; we used `volt` and `vala`.  
The suffixal future forms of Old Hungarian (`-and`, `-end`) crop up in present continuous tenses, e.g. in Spanish “Estoy trabajando.” = "I am working". How come? Is it somewhere in Latin as well?  
And of course, as always, history — properly told — will give the answers on just what kind of people are living in Europe. Science, as long as it is a servant of those running the show called usury civilization, “will not want” to “come in possession” of truth and reality. Science is a “had-been” or a “have be going to.”
