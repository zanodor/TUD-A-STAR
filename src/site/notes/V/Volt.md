# Volt



T√∂bbf√©lek√©ppen √©rtelmezhet≈ë volt szavunk. Egyr√©szt M>V v√°lt√°ssal kij√∂n [[M/M√∫lt\|m√∫lt]] szavunkb√≥l, m√°sr√©szt megfelel a forg√°sra utal√≥ [[V/V√°lt\|v√°lt]] szavunknak is, ahogy [ezen](https://qr.ae/pKIRyJ) Quora v√°laszban[^1] is szerepelt.  
[[B/Bolt\|Bolt]] pedig az √©gbolt, ami (illetve rajta a csillagok) szint√©n forog(nak).  

Ugyanakkor a [[T/T\|T]] a m√∫lt id≈ë jele is. Ezek szerint vol- kereshet≈ë lenne jelen id≈ës jelent√©ssel? [[B/B√°l\|B√°l]] √©s [[B/BUL\|bul]] nevek vannak a hasonl√≥ak k√∂z√ºl.  
Ugyeb√°r az id≈ë foly√°sa ([[F/Foly√≥\|foly-]] szint√©n ilyen alak√∫ sz√≥!) vagy sziderikusan vagy tropikusan (szol√°risan) k√∂vethet≈ë. Az pedig alapvet≈ë a magyar nyelv szavai logik√°j√°t tekintve, hogy a Nap-F√∂ld rel√°ci√≥ra √©p√≠t.

[^1]: L√°bjegyzet:  
*Are there any complex structures similar to the English ‚Äúhave be going to‚Äù or ‚Äúwill have been gone‚Äù in Finnish, Estonian, Hungarian, and Turkish? Why and why not? How is it expressed?*  
‚ÄúHave be going to‚Äù is incorrect English.  
‚ÄúWill have been gone‚Äù is hardly used in English, either. These are pretty niche cases.  
As for Hungarian, the language had many more cases, including a future tense (`j√∂vend` = will come; compare `j√∂vend≈ë` = future (poetic, formal); `j√∂v≈ë` = future (normal usage)), but the anti-Hungarian forces (Vatican/Catholicism, chief among them the Jesuits, then Habsburg rule) did much damage to the language.  
If one looks closely at the old forms in Hungarian (`volt,` `vala` to construct simple past and/or past perfect tenses) and how Latin and Germanic (based on Latin) are gramatically syntaxed, one can say they could have been formed on a language that could easily have been Hungarian itself.  
Are the Latin and Germanic words expressing volition and future tenses connected to our words `volt` and `vala`, based on the fact that in the circle of time past becomes future (what comes around goes around)?  
(`Volt`, by the way equals `m√∫lt` = past, in case any Hungarians were ever wondering. In fact, these words are related to `v√°lt` = change; turn.)  
See also, for example, `habere`, `haben` are used for possession and present/past perfect. But in order to be in a state of possession or have done something, you must have come into the possession or state of having done something. Hungarian `kap` = come in possession of, receive. Is it a coincidence? Although I am sure we never used a variation of `kap` for any of these tenses; we used `volt` and `vala`.  
The suffixal future forms of Old Hungarian (`-and`, `-end`) crop up in present continuous tenses, e.g. in Spanish ‚ÄúEstoy trabajando.‚Äù = "I am working". How come? Is it somewhere in Latin as well?  
And of course, as always, history ‚Äî properly told ‚Äî will give the answers on just what kind of people are living in Europe. Science, as long as it is a servant of those running the show called usury civilization, ‚Äúwill not want‚Äù to ‚Äúcome in possession‚Äù of truth and reality. Science is a ‚Äúhad-been‚Äù or a ‚Äúhave be going to.‚Äù
